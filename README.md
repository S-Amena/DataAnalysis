# IPL Data Analysis using AI/ML

The Indian Premier League is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India in 2008.  

This project focuses on analyzing historical data from the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** using various **AI/ML techniques** to extract insights, evaluate performance, and build predictive models.

âž¤ **Objective:**
To uncover hidden patterns in IPL matches and build models that can **predict match outcomes**, identify **top-performing players**, and understand the **impact of factors** like toss, venue, and team combinations.

âž¤ **Dataset Used:**
Cleaned and processed IPL dataset containing match details, player stats, toss info, venue, and team performance from multiple seasons.

âž¤ **Key Technologies:**

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Scikit-learn** for ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
* **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization
* **GitHub** for version control and project management

âž¤ **Workflow Sequence:**

1. ðŸ“¥ **Data Collection** â€“ Acquired IPL match data
2. ðŸ§¹ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ Handled missing values, data types
3. ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Plotted team wins, player stats, toss trends
4. ðŸ§  **Model Building** â€“ Applied classification algorithms to predict match results
5. ðŸ“ˆ **Model Evaluation** â€“ Compared accuracy of each model
6. ðŸ§¾ **Conclusion & Insights** â€“ Extracted meaningful conclusions from the results

âž¤ **Output Highlights:**

* Predicting winner based on toss and venue
* Top 10 batsmen & bowlers visualized per season
* Win probability modeling
* Accuracy comparison of models

âž¤ **Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates how **machine learning models** can be used to **make data-driven predictions** and support sports analytics. It helps enhance decision-making for teams, fans, and analysts.
